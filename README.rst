paletti
=======

Not much to see yet, but there is some documentation_.

This project is in prototyping stage, that's why there is no install 
script yet, and bugs are to be expected.

Paletti comes without plugins and pull request for plugins will be denied.
However, since they are loaded dynamically from the plugins folder, it's
just a matter of putting the files in there. Paletti can download
plugins from a github repository, see the documentation/introduction for an
example.
